# jobboard
This was my first project working with PHP &amp; MySQL. Although is not perfect, I am really proud of that project.  Everything is dynamically fetched from database. First of all, user can see all jobs posted by every employer. It has functionality of filtering, paging. Once user apply for a job, on the profile section employer can see all applications and choose person that best fits. Profile page, based on user role, employer can fully crud operated on jobs and employee can managed their own applications. Employer can also contact interested people through the site. For logged user site has a survey system.
